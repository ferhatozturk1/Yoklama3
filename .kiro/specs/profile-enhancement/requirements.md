# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement focuses on improving the existing profile management system by adding Turkish localization, file upload functionality for profile photos, and API integration capabilities. The enhancement will transform the current static profile display into a dynamic, user-friendly system that supports both Turkish and English languages, allows users to upload profile photos, and integrates with backend APIs for data management.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload a profile photo using a file upload field instead of a text input, so that I can easily set my profile picture with actual image files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the profile photo section THEN the system SHALL display a file upload component instead of a text field
2. WHEN a user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL validate that the file is an image format (jpg, jpeg, png, gif)
3. WHEN a user uploads a valid image THEN the system SHALL display a preview of the uploaded image
4. WHEN a user uploads an image larger than 5MB THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the upload
5. WHEN a user uploads an invalid file type THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Turkish user, I want all interface text to be displayed in Turkish, so that I can use the application in my native language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN all section labels SHALL be displayed in Turkish
2. WHEN viewing the profile form THEN "Profile Photo" SHALL be displayed as "Profil Fotoğrafı"
3. WHEN viewing the profile form THEN "Email Information" SHALL be displayed as "E-posta Bilgileri"
4. WHEN viewing the profile form THEN "Phone Number" SHALL be displayed as "Telefon Numarası"
5. WHEN viewing the profile form THEN "Compulsory Education Info" SHALL be displayed as "Zorunlu Eğitim Bilgileri"

8. WHEN viewing the profile form THEN "Department" SHALL be displayed as "Bölüm"
9. WHEN viewing the profile form THEN "University" SHALL be displayed as "Üniversite"
10. WHEN viewing the profile form THEN "Edit Profile" SHALL be displayed as "Profili Düzenle"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the profile system to integrate with backend APIs, so that user data can be dynamically loaded and saved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the profile component loads THEN the system SHALL attempt to fetch user data from the API
2. WHEN API data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL populate all profile fields with the received data
3. WHEN the API is not available THEN the system SHALL display placeholder data and show an appropriate message
4. WHEN a user edits their profile THEN the system SHALL send updated data to the API
5. WHEN API integration is ready THEN only the API connection configuration SHALL remain as a manual setup step
6. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages in Turkish

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit my profile information through an intuitive interface, so that I can keep my information up to date.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Profili Düzenle" THEN the system SHALL enable editing mode for all profile fields
2. WHEN in editing mode THEN all text fields SHALL become editable
3. WHEN in editing mode THEN the profile photo upload field SHALL be functional
4. WHEN a user saves changes THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL save changes and return to view mode
6. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each invalid field

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the profile interface to be responsive and accessible, so that I can use it effectively on different devices and with assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the profile on mobile devices THEN the layout SHALL adapt to smaller screen sizes
2. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all interactive elements SHALL be accessible via tab navigation
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN all form fields SHALL have appropriate labels and descriptions
4. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN the profile photo and form fields SHALL remain properly aligned
5. WHEN uploading files on mobile THEN the file picker SHALL work correctly with device cameras and galleries
